# Spotify Data Analysis
Analyzes your Spotify listening data collected through IFTTTT and stored in Google Sheets

## Setting It Up
1. You will need [https://ifttt.com/applets/nin7BxVm-keep-a-log-of-your-recently-played-tracks](this IFTTTT applet) and connect it to an account with Google Sheets
2. Wait for your data to roll in as you listen to songs!
3. Make sure the Google Sheet that is created is open for viewing for anyone with a link
4. Copy the Google Sheet link <b>from the browser</b> (i.e. not the link that Sheets gives you to share, yes they are different!) insert it in line XX of the code
5. Run the code! (Feel free to change it accordingly, I usually run this at the end of each month to see my monthly round-up and other cool data facts)
